# ERCOT Beyond the Adder: A Forensic Analysis of Price Formation

**Status:** Public Release (v1.0)  
**Event Window:** January 2026 ("Fern" Stress Event)  
**Focus:** Real-Time Co-optimization (RTC+B), Battery Feasibility, and Scarcity Migration

## 📉 Overview

This repository contains the analytical code, data schema, and reproducibility artifacts for the technical report **"ERCOT Beyond the Adder."**

The project provides a forensic reconstruction of market outcomes during the **Winter Storm Fern** stress event (Jan 2026). It challenges the legacy heuristic of monitoring Operating Reserve Demand Curve (ORDC) adders, demonstrating instead that under the RTC+B regime, scarcity value structurally migrates to **Ancillary Service (AS) Market Clearing Prices for Capacity (MCPC)** when intertemporal feasibility constraints bind.

## 🔑 Key Findings

1.  **Scarcity Migration:** During the Fern event, energy-side scarcity adders ($a^{RT}$) remained compressed, while AS prices (ECRS, Reg-Up) exhibited extreme tail behavior. This confirms the **KKT prediction** that binding State-of-Charge (SoC) constraints isolate the AS market from the energy market.
2.  **Stack Geometry ($H_k$):** The root cause of "paper length" vs. "real-time scarcity" was **supply stack convexity**. Our analysis of Day-Ahead awards shows the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index ($H_k$) for marginal blocks spiked ($>0.4$), creating a brittle supply curve sensitive to minor feasibility shocks.
3.  **Feasibility as Scarcity:** We introduce the **Participation Exhaustion** proxy, distinguishing between strategic withholding and physical depletion. The data suggests that **Feasibility Truncation** (running out of duration) was the binding constraint for the storage fleet.

## 🛠️ Methodology & Replication

### 1. The "Fern" Protocol

To avoid circular reasoning, this analysis defines the stress window using **Price-Blind Physical Triggers** (Section 2.4 of the report):

* **Load Trigger:** System Load  of seasonal baseline.
* **Weather Trigger:** Temperature deviations .
* *Note: Intervals are selected BEFORE analyzing price outcomes.*

### 2. Traceability Rule

All metrics are derived exclusively from **Settlement-Grade Artifacts**:

* `NP6-332-CD`: Real-Time MCPC and LMP.
* `NP4-19-CD`: Day-Ahead Ancillary Service Awards.

### 3. Running the Analysis

The core analysis relies on Python 3.10+.

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone [https://github.com/your-org/ercot-beyond-adder.git](https://github.com/your-org/ercot-beyond-adder.git)

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Geometry diagnostic
python src/geometry_metrics.py --window "2026-01-20_to_2026-02-05"

```

## 📊 Visualizations

Key visualizations generated by this codebase include:

* **Stack Convexity Plot:** Visualizing the shift from "Broad" to "Vertical" supply stacks.
* **The Price Layer Cake:** Decomposing  into LMP, Adders, and MCPC components.
* **Re-Entry CDF:** Distinguishing physical recharge latency from economic withholding.
